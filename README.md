# Pharmacy Management Simulator in C

This C code is a pharmacy management simulator where you need to enter medication information

such as name, brand, price (in DA), manufacturing date, and expiration date. You also need to entertoday's date (the current day).

The program includes a menu where you can search for a medication by a partial name or the full name directly.

You can add information about the medication, adjust the quantity, or remove it.

If a medication's quantity is low and it is close to expiring, a red warning message will appear.

Additionally, you can save all your medication data when you exit the program.

When you reload your saved data, if a medication has expired, the program will ask if you still want to load it.

# Important Notes

If you save your data but encounter an error while reloading, please provide the absolute path to the save file (if it already exists).

You can find the relevant code at line 423.
